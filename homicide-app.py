This project aims to explore the applicability of various machine learning models to predict whether a crime was solved, based on a comprehensive dataset. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the implementation of multiple predictive models, the study seeks to enhance the understanding of factors influencing crime resolution. The dataset used for this project is derived from the Murder Accountability Project, an extensively compiled database of homicides in the United States. It was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jyzaguirre/us-homicide-reports), and consists of more than 600k cases for the period between 1980 and 2014.

Each model will be evaluated based on accuracy and ROC curve performance to assess how effectively it distinguishes between solved and unsolved crimes. Additionally, important features contributing to the prediction will be identified and analyzed.")
